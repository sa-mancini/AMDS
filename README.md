## 📚 Project Description

As part of the university coursework, I built a **Recommendation System** based on **Collaborative Filtering** using the Alternating Least Squares (**ALS**) matrix factorization algorithm, implemented from scratch. Two solutions were differentiated in order to evaluate scalability:  (i) a standard Python version on a substantially subsampled dataset, and (ii) a large-scale distributed version using Apache Spark. Both models were trained on a subset of user-book rating data, and evaluated against random and popularity baselines. The latent spaces were analyzed using dimensionality reduction (PCA) for both datasets, while the subsampled model was further explored through a graph of top recommendations with Louvain clustering.
