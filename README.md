## üìö Project Description

As part of the university coursework, I built a **Recommendation System** based on **Collaborative Filtering** using the Alternating Least Squares (**ALS**) matrix factorization algorithm, implemented from scratch. Two solutions were differentiated in order to evaluate scalability:  (i) a standard Python version on a substantially subsampled dataset, and (ii) a large-scale distributed version using Apache Spark. Both models were trained on a subset of user-book rating data, and evaluated against random and popularity-based baselines. Raw and latent spaces are compared using dimensionality reduction (PCA), cluster analysis, and performance metrics interpretation.
